## Getting Started

- [Binary outcomes](#binary-outcomes), like conversion rate
- [Count data](#count-data), like number of sales per salesperson

## Binary Outcomes

```rust
use bayestest::BinaryTest;

let mut test = BinaryTest::new();
test.add(participants_a, conversions_a);
test.add(participants_b, conversions_b);
let probabilities = test.probabilities();
```

Supports up to 4 variants

## Count Data

```rust
use bayestest::CountTest;

let mut test = CountTest::new();
test.add(events_a, exposure_a);
test.add(events_b, exposure_b);
let probabilities = test.probabilities();
```

Supports up to 3 variants
